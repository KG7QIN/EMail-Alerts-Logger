Simple SMTP server based on tsmtp-c by Tomas Varneckas (https://github.com/tomasv/tsmtp-c.git)

Takes emails received and logs them to syslog.

After a a single successul message, the server will say bye.
If any commands are sent out of sequence or invalid, the server will say bye.

Full syslog session logging for debugging multiple session activity.

Implemented commands:
HELO
MAIL FROM
RCPT TO (limited to only one receipient)
DATA
<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>
QUIT
